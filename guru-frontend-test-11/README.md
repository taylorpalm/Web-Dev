## Guru Frontend Test

Congratulations on making it to this stage! ðŸŽ‰

We will be grading your test based on:

- How much your app looks like the provided mockups. The mockups are in the `src/` folder as `Mockup.jpg` and `ExpandedMockup.jpg`
- How many Jest Tests pass. You can see them any time by clicking the `Tests` tab above the browser preview.
- How many of the requirements listed below are complete.

We don't expect a perfect test, so please submit whatever you have. The main entry point for the test is `src/index.js`. To get rid of this prompt, comment out the `<Assignment />` component.

## Requirements

1.  The app should load data from `https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/http://interviewtest.getguru.com/seismic/data.json`. This data comes in the form of an array of earthquakes. An earthquake looks something like this.

```json
{
  "time": "2017-09-08T12:46:04.610Z",
  "latitude": 15.348,
  "longitude": -93.9526,
  "depth": 66.08,
  "mag": 4.7,
  "magType": "mb",
  "id": "us2000ai1z",
  "place": "72km SW of Tres Picos, Mexico",
  "type": "earthquake"
}
```

2.  The app should render these earthquakes as a table with each earthquake as a row. **However, there are some very specific rules that need to be followed:**

    1.  There should be a text input that allows the user to filter the earthquakes by **place**. Not by any other field.
    2.  You should sort the earthquakes by **highest magnitude to lowest magnitude**. In the event some earthquakes share the same magnitude, **the most recent ones should win.**
    3.  After sorting and filtering the earthquakes, you should show no more than 20 results. **Pagination is not required.**

3.  Each earthquake should show the following columns exactly like this

| ID         | Time                  | Location                         | Magnitude | More      |
| ---------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------- | --------- |
| us2000ai1z | July 25, 2017 @ 19:23 | 228km SSW of Bengkulu, Indonesia | 5.3       | [Details] |

4.  The details column should render a button that says details. Clicking on it should show you the longitude and latitude for the earthquake.
5.  The time column should be formatted as shown above.
